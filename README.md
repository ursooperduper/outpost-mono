# Outpost Mono

A futuristic monospace font designed for the terminals of martian outposts, but ready for your terminal and editors today.

Outpost Mono is currently in *beta* and available in one weight only - regular. At least two additional weights are planned in the term, bold and light.

## Language Support

Currently, Outpost Mono offers support for Latin, Cyrillic, and basic Greek languages. Additional language support may be added based on interest.
